# Thinking In Java

This repo will be dedicated to the exercises that I will be going through as I progress through the book "Thinking in Java". My goal is to learn Git and Java at the same time. I hope to learn a lot through this progress and may this serve as a record and journal of the journey that I take as I progress through my learning.
